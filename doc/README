#################################################Conclusion############################################################
1. Maximum fitness increases as more mutation accumulates. That is, the best variant in HD = 4 is better than HD = 3, 2, or 1. 
2. By partitioning these four positions, (i.e. position 39, 40, 41, and 54), actual fitness of HD = 4 can be best predicted by position 40 vs position 39-41-54. Position 41 and 54 has strong epistasis. Fitness effect of position 40 is largely additive.
3. The fitness of certain HD = 4 variants can be much higher than predicted fitness regardless of partitioning methods.
4. Most substitutions can be beneficial in one genetic background but deleterious in another genetic backgrounds
5. Most HD = 4 variants are accessible from WT with multiple shortest routes
